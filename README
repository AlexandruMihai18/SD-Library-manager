## Tema 2 - The Library of HashBabel

### Description:

* This project was meant to develop one's abilities of handling and
manipulating hashtables by requiring the implementation of a virtual
library, containing a book and a user database.

* Both the library and the books themselves were stored generically
using the common hashtable data structure. However additional functionalities
such as resize and updating features that was meant to minimise
the memory resources used.

* The informating from the book can be erased or update according to one's
preferences by adding or removing a certain definition from the book hashtable.

* The users were stored, as well, in a hashtable and the program is able
to offer some functionalities regarding the interaction between users
and library. A user can borrow a book from the library for a certain number
of days, can give a rating to the book, as well as be awarded points
for returning it in time. However, returning it late or losing it may
therefore result in a low score for the user or even getting banned
from this library.

* At the end of the day the top books and users will be displayed, task
that was successfully achieved by recursively printing the top book/user
and then removing it from the hashtable.


### Personal comments:

* Probably, the most difficult part of this project was the resizing function
of the hashtable, considering that unlike a regular rebuild some information was
still memorized and could not have been removed from the memory.

* Apart from that however, the project was overall very interesting and quite
intuitive for a Computer Science student and I could have better understand
some hashtables features that I was quite hesitant to use and implement (such
as of course the resizing feature)
